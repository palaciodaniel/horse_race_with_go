# Horse Race with Go

Having recently completed a [Sololearn certification in Go](https://www.sololearn.com/profile/13506786), it was time to showcase what I have learned with a new repository. Since I did not want to spoil the solutions for the featured Sololearn projects at the end of every module, I decided to create this code sample instead, where the concepts of *concurrency* and *subroutines* are clearly applied on a simple but easy-to-imagine situation: a horse race, where every subroutine is represented by a horseman.

Although you will find attached here the file, if you want to run the code you can simply enter [this link](https://play.golang.org/p/OIQCnBzJhgd), where you can directly execute it in the Go Playground. Just press **Run** and do not forget to keep scrolling down!
